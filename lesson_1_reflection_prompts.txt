How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It was easy to see which lines had been added by looking for the + character in
the output. It is also possible to check if any crucial code has been removed by
looking for the - character.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

It would be quicker to locate code changes and find where bugs have been
introduced.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

You may forget to make a commit at a crucial point. Conversely, auto-save may 
not commit at an important point.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

This is use case. Google Docs deal with a single file that you are working on,
whereas a codebase may involve changes to multiple files to implement a new
feature.
